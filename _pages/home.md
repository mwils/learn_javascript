** Not Proofread (This is a published draft)**
My goal for Matw.me is to create an easy to read, but informative Javascript reference that covers the "core" and "essential" parts of Javascript. Furthermore, I would like to present this information clearly and simple enough that is can be used as a learning reference for beginning developers, but at the same time teach the hard concepts that even professionals find difficult or don't bother to study.

I plan to accomplish this by starting at the basics, and add higher level concepts only after base knowledge is laid down. Concepts that require prior knowledge to understand will be notated as such and have references to theÂ prerequisite material.
