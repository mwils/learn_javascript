<h3>Reading list</h3>
Just a place for me to keep useful links for myself. You may find them useful to of course.
<h4>Javascript - General</h4>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>

Codeschool had an excellent JavaScript course taught by Jason Millhouse, but they are now part of Pluralsight. For now the course is still available, but I'm not sure if they will keep it up forever.Â <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/code-school-javascript-road-trip-part-1">https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/code-school-javascript-road-trip-part-1</a>
<h4>HTML</h4>
Once again the top spot here goes to MDN. They have excellent post covering <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">HTML basics here</a>. But as usual with MDN, its thorough and accurate.
<h4>CSS</h4>
Here is a free interactive course with a focus on CSS https://scrimba.com/p/pWvwCg/c3vE7cg
<h4>PouchDB / CouchDB</h4>
